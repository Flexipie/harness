# CLI contract

2026-11-03. Flags follow the binary `0.y.z` axis and the payloads follow the shared
contract number ([CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) "Versions"). The `chaperone` binary keeps the argv, the `{ok, data, meta}`
envelope and the exit codes of `daisy-cli` 0.2.0 (contract 1), so a skill moves from
daisy to Chaperone by changing the binary path. That switch happens after the first demo
([ADR 0003](decisions/0003-chaperone-replaces-daisy.md)). The events each command writes
are in [events.md](events.md).

## Global flags and actor

| Flag or env | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `--db <PATH>` | The ledger file. Without it, the CLI's default path in the user data dir (`dirs`, #7). Core takes a path and reads no environment. |
| `--format json\|jsonl` | `json` (default) is one object. `jsonl` is one item per line, then a trailer. |
| `--agent`, `DAISY_AGENT` | `[a-z0-9._-]{1,40}`. Required by every write. |
| `--session`, `DAISY_SESSION` | `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,120}`. Required by every write. |
| `DAISY_CLI_READONLY=1` | Refuses every command that is not a read, `--dry-run` included (`read_only`). |
| `--dry-run` | Validates and prints what would be written. Writes nothing. |

The env names stay `DAISY_*` because `spawn` and the skills already export them.

## Envelope

- **Success:** one `{ok: true, data, meta}` on stdout.
- **Failure:** one `{ok: false, error: {code, message, retryable, details}, meta}` on stderr.
- **`meta`:** `{cli_version, schema_version, source_freshness}`. `schema_version` is the
  ledger's `PRAGMA user_version`. `source_freshness` is always `null`, because Chaperone
  has no mirrors.

`text` output and `--help` are for people and are not part of the contract. `--help`
output has snapshot tests.

## Exit codes

| Exit | Name | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `ok` | |
| 1 | `error` | Every error code without its own exit. |
| 2 | `usage` | Bad argv. |
| 3 | `schema_mismatch` | The ledger's `user_version` is not this binary's, or its `application_id` is not Chaperone's, or it is not SQLite at all. The file is left untouched. |
| 4 | `conflict` | A CAS miss, a held lease, or a stale `--expected-version`. |
| 5 | `runtime_unavailable` | Only passed through from `daisy-cli reviews get`. |

## Error codes

Daisy's ten codes, plus two from the engine.

| Code | Exit | `details` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `not_found` | 1 | `entity`, `id` (or `entity`, `reference`) | |
| `invalid_input` | 1 | | Validation, caps, and the check session rule. Writes nothing. |
| `busy` | 1 | | `retryable: true`. `SQLITE_BUSY` after the 5 s busy timeout. |
| `conflict` | 4 | `entity` (or `by`, `until` for a held lease) | Pass `--takeover` for a lease. |
| `schema_mismatch` | 3 | `found`, `supported`, `hint` | Newer file: refused, upgrade the binary. Older or missing file: `hint` says run `chaperone migrate`. Foreign file (wrong `application_id`): refused. |
| `usage` | 2 | `kind`, `help` | |
| `db` | 1 | | |
| `internal` | 1 | | |
| `runtime_unavailable` | 5 | `job_id`, `poll` | `retryable: true`. |
| `read_only` | 1 | `command`, `mutability` | |
| `gate_denied` | 1 | `transition`, `gate`, `fact_paths` | One `gate.denied` was appended. The failing gate id is also on stderr's message. |
| `pipeline_unknown` | 1 | `pipeline_id`, `pipeline_hash` | Claim or transition on a hash this binary cannot load. Writes nothing. |

## Lists

- **Shape:** `{items, next_cursor, has_more}`.
- **Paging:** `--limit` defaults to 50 and accepts 1 to 500. `--cursor` takes an opaque,
  command-specific value from `next_cursor`.
- **`jsonl`:** one item per line, then one trailer, which is the only line with an `ok`
  key and carries `meta.page`.

## Statuses

Wire statuses: `queued`, `claimed`, `active`, `blocked`, `review`, `done`, `cancelled`.
Ready is not a status (events.md, folded rows). `transition_ok(from, to)` is daisy's:

| From | Allowed to |
| --- | --- |
| `queued` | `blocked`, `done`, `cancelled` |
| `claimed` | `active`, `blocked`, `review`, `done`, `cancelled` |
| `active` | `blocked`, `review`, `done`, `cancelled` |
| `blocked` | `active`, `review`, `done`, `cancelled` |
| `review` | `active`, `done`, `cancelled` |
| `done`, `cancelled` | `queued` (reopen) |

`claim` moves `queued` to `claimed` and `release` moves it back. Moving to `blocked`
needs `--blocker` or `--reason`.

## Commands in M1

Every write except `migrate` also takes `--agent` and `--session`, and every write but `migrate`, `check record`, `reviews record`, `usage report`, `work merged`, `attention record` and `dossier note` takes `--dry-run`. `[x]` is optional.

`work create --kind` and `--pr-flow` are Chaperone's two additions to daisy's argv (#7). Both are optional and stored on `lane.created`. `--kind` defaults to `code` and `--pr-flow` to `pr`, so a skill that passes neither gets the strictest route. #14 reads them at the first claim, when the route is stamped.

`chaperone migrate` is the only command that creates the ledger or migrates it (`Ledger::open_and_migrate`, with a `VACUUM INTO` backup before an upgrade, #4). It creates a missing or empty file. It refuses a non-empty file whose `application_id` is not Chaperone's, a file that is not SQLite, and a version-0 file that already has tables, so it never applies 0001 over someone else's database. Every other command opens with `Ledger::open`, which never creates or migrates and refuses a mismatch with exit 3. Migration 0001 sets `PRAGMA application_id`, and open checks it, so a foreign SQLite file at version 1 is refused (#7).

`work handoff` reads the JSON from `<file>`, or from stdin when the file is omitted or `-`. A handoff with `ready: true` or to `done` runs the `handoff` gate (commands and transitions below). The write itself refuses a `lane.handed_off` that says ready and any event but `phase.entered` that moves a lane to `done`, so no path skips the gate.

`work merged` is new (#59). `/merge` runs it after the merge, from any session (it skips the
holder rule and leaves `updated_at` alone, as `check record` does). It appends one
`pr.merged` (events.md, PR). It refuses (`invalid_input`, nothing written) a `--pr` that is not
`owner/repo#N` or that the item has never held, a PR already merged on another item, a sha that
is not 7 to 40 lowercase hex digits, and a `--merged-at` that is not RFC 3339 UTC with
milliseconds (GitHub's `mergedAt`, `2026-11-05T10:00:00Z`, is passed as
`2026-11-05T10:00:00.000Z`). The same PR again replays. It prints `{event_id, work_id, kind, replayed, at,
payload}`.

`attention record` is new (#59). `/orchestrate` and the owner run it for each intervention on
a lane, from any session (it skips the holder rule and leaves `updated_at` alone). It appends
one `attention.recorded` (events.md, Attention). It refuses (`invalid_input`, nothing written)
an `asked` without `--reason`, a `--reason` on another type, a `sent_back` without `--round` of
1 or more, an `answered` without `--answers` and `--note` or whose `--answers` is not a question
asked on that item, `--answers` or `--round` on another type, and a note that is blank, has a line break or is
over 500 characters. `--idempotency-key` is trimmed (blank is no key, over 200 characters is refused, as for
`work create`) and scoped to the item and type, so the same key on another item, or on a
question and its answer, is a separate record. Without `--idempotency-key`, a record repeated with nothing new on the lane
replays; a real repeat (a second nudge on a stalled lane) passes its own key. It prints
`{event_id, work_id, kind, replayed, at, payload}`.

`dossier note` and `dossier get` are new (#83, [ADR 0007](decisions/0007-issue-dossier.md)).
`<key>` is `owner/repo#N` or `TEAM-123` (`normalize_key`); a bare `#N` is `invalid_input`.
`dossier note` appends one `dossier.noted` (events.md, Dossier) on the key, from any session; it
names no lane, so it never changes a lane's `updated_at`. It refuses (`invalid_input`, nothing
written) a blank note or one over 600 characters, more than 5 `--link`, a link whose kind is not
`issue`, `pr`, `adr`, `doc` or `commit` or whose ref is not an identifier of that kind (a tracker
key, `owner/repo#N`, a repo-relative path with no `..`, 7 to 64 hex digits; at most 300
characters), and a `--supersedes` that is not a note on the same key. The note is redacted at
write; a secret in a link is refused. The same note again from the same session replays, unless
another note on the key came in between that says something else. It prints `{event_id, kind,
replayed, at, payload}`.

`dossier get` reads in one transaction and prints `{key, slice, lanes, handoffs, files, notes}`.
`slice` is `{in_spec, parent_of, omitted}`: the slice whose heading names the key (its spec, title
and the decisions `spec get --key` shows, each as its line) and the spec whose parent the key is
(title, version, slice count, decisions), either null. `lanes` is every work item whose `linear`,
`issue` or `github` source id is the key, ignoring case: `id`, `title`, `status`, `branch`,
`pr_ref`, `agent`, `pipeline_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. `handoffs.items` are each lane's
handoffs (`work_id`, `at`, `status`, `ready`, `next_action`, `commit`, `pull_request`, `summary`)
and `handoffs.decisions` the brief's decisions of each lane's newest handoff. `files` are the
newest handoff's `changed_files` per lane, with the lane and the handoff's `commit`. `notes` are
the key's notes no later note supersedes: `id`, `at`, `agent`, `session`, `note`, `links`,
`supersedes`. Lanes and items in them come newest first. Caps: 10 lanes, 5 handoffs and 5
decisions per lane, 20 spec decisions, 100 files, 20 notes; every string at 300 characters, a note
at 600. The whole answer as printed (the pretty envelope, `meta` included) is at most 48,000 bytes,
cut from the end of notes, then files, handoff decisions, handoffs and lanes; the slice is never
cut. Each section's `omitted` counts what it left out by list (`slice_decisions` and
`spec_decisions` in `slice`), and `strings` the strings it cut short. A key with no slice, spec, lane
or note is `not_found`. Notes are someone else's words: no gate reads them.

`work ready` is the owner's override. It is refused (`invalid_input`) from any session that has held the lane, the same honor-system rule as `check record`. It answers daisy's way: `{id, ready, ready_reason}` from the board (read for that item only, without `overlaps`), or `{id, ready_override, on_board: false}` for a done or cancelled item.

`work board` is daisy's board shape, `{specs, other}`, one read statement. Its rows are written as they are read to an unlinked, owner-only temp file, so the CLI never holds the whole board; stdout gets the file once the read has ended, so a slow or stalled reader never holds a WAL snapshot, and a ledger error leaves stdout empty. It needs a writable temp dir (`TMPDIR`); without one it fails `internal` with `temp file: ...`. Every open item (not `done` or `cancelled`) is under `other`, ordered by `lane_key`, `lane_pos`, `id`; `specs` stays empty until items are grouped by spec. Each entry is `{item, handoff, ready_override, ready, ready_reason, overlaps, overlaps_omitted}`: `item` is `work get`'s, `handoff` the newest `work handoffs` row or null, and `ready_override` the newest `work ready` as `{ready, reason, by, at}`, null when there is none or it was cleared. The ready rule is daisy's first steps: the override wins (`marked ready by <agent>: <reason>`); else an item not in `review` is not ready (`status is <s>, not review`); else it is ready only when its newest handoff says ready (`the lane says ready`, else `the lane has not said ready`). A ready handoff exists only past the `handoff` gate, so a later `needs you` handoff unsays it. Daisy's further steps, a finished review on the PR head and no open thread from a person, need the PR and are the caller's to check; the board does not notice commits pushed after the gated handoff. `lanes` checks threads for every repo but the review on the head only for repos daisy does not review, so before it reads this board for a daisy-reviewed repo it has to check the review on the head there too. Daisy's other board fields (`pr_head`, `pr_state`, `pr_review`, `local_review`, `linear_outbox`, `threads`, `threads_checked`, `needs_you`) are not emitted.

`overlaps` (#42) flags two open lanes touching the same file: each path this lane's newest handoff lists in `changed_files` that another open lane's newest handoff in the same repo (`repo_slug`, any case) also lists, as `{path, work_ids, work_ids_omitted}`: the other lanes' lowest 10 ids and how many more touch it, sorted by path, the first 50 paths, the rest counted in `overlaps_omitted`. The read groups lanes by path, so lanes sharing a path cost it linear work, not a row per pair. Paths are compared as given, less a leading `./` or the lane's `worktree_path`. A lane with no `repo_slug` is never compared. It reads handoffs only, in the same statement, never git, and lanes usually hand off late, so an empty list does not mean no overlap: `overlap` adds what each worktree holds now.

`overlap` lists, per file, the open lanes touching it, so an agent or the orchestrator can call it before starting work (and `/ship` before ready). It reads the board (one snapshot) and only after that read has ended runs `git` in each lane's `worktree_path`, so a slow git never holds the ledger. Sources per lane: its newest handoff's `changed_files` (`source: handoff`, `commit` the handoff's), and its worktree (`source: worktree`, `commit` its `HEAD`): the paths its own commits touch since the merge-base with the first of `origin/HEAD`, `origin/main`, `origin/master` (else the claimed `base_sha`), one `git log --no-renames` per lane (one more for each base that does not resolve, up to 4) that reads commits only, so both sides of a rename, and not what the lane merged from the base. `--uncommitted` adds one `git status` per lane for uncommitted and untracked (not ignored) paths; it stats every tracked file, so it costs about 4x at 50 lanes on a 400-file repo and grows with the repo. Git runs as the binary its `--exec-path` names (macOS's `/usr/bin/git` shim adds about 9 ms a call), with `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`, so it never takes the lane's index lock, `LC_ALL=C`, and without the variables that point git at another repository (`GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and the like, which git sets in hooks), so a caller inside a hook still reads each lane's own worktree. Bounds: one `git --exec-path` per run, at most 8 lanes at a time, every git call of the run within one 5 s deadline, 256 KiB of output per git call and 500 paths per lane. `data` is `{files, files_omitted, lanes}`. `files` is `{repo, path, shared, lanes: [{id, source, commit}]}`, `shared` true when two or more lanes touch it; shared rows come first, then by repo and path, the first 2,000, the rest counted in `files_omitted`. `lanes` has one row per open lane, `{id, repo, worktree, paths, cut, error?}`: `worktree` is `ok`, `none` (no worktree recorded), `missing` (not a directory), `no_base` (no base resolved; a repo git cannot read at all, such as a missing HEAD object, also lands here), `timed_out` (git did not finish, or never started, by the deadline), `error` (git failed for another reason than a missing base, such as a directory that is not a git worktree; `error` has git's last line, the fatal one) or `no_repo` (no `repo_slug`: listed, never compared); `paths` is how many worktree paths were kept and `cut` a count of what was dropped, not exact: output cut at 256 KiB counts as one, and a dropped path several commits touch counts once per commit. A lane that is not `ok` has only its handoff's files in `files`, so read `lanes` before taking a missing row as no overlap. `--repo` keeps one repo's lanes, any case. Worktree paths are not printed, except where git's own `error` line names one. The answer is written to stdout as it is serialized, after the read, with no copy held.

`stats` is new (#89). It prints [R11](research/r11-observability-cost-metrics.md)'s numbers for a cohort of lanes, read from the log in one statement (the cohort's events in lane order, each lane folded once); nothing is stored, so every total is a sum over events. The cohort is the lanes with a `pr.merged` whose `merged_at` is at or after `--merged-since` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, read as 00:00 UTC, or RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds; anything else is `invalid_input`), or the `--work` ids (repeat the flag; a repeated id counts once, an unknown one is `not_found`). An empty cohort is `lanes: 0` with null medians. `data` is `{cohort, lanes}`.

Each lane is `{id, title, kind, pipeline_id, claimed_at, merged_at, claim_to_merge_h, with_pr, merged, tokens, peak_context, attention, send_back_rounds, plan_check, quality_gate, merge_verdict, verdict_on_head, head_reviewed, flat_rounds, reraised_findings, verified_findings, verified_findings_after_handoff, commits_after_handoff}`:

- `claimed_at` is the first `lane.claimed` (a reopened lane keeps it, so its wait counts), `merged_at` the latest `pr.merged.merged_at`, and `claim_to_merge_h` the hours between them, only when every PR the lane held (`pr.opened` or a `changed.pr_ref.to`) has merged (`merged`).
- `tokens` is keyed by `source` (`parent`, `subagent`) with the sums of `input_total`, `cache_read`, `cache_write` and `output_total`, skipping nulls as `usage get` does; null when the lane has no usage event. `peak_context` is the largest parent `input_total`.
- `attention` counts `attention.recorded` by `type`; `send_back_rounds` is the highest `sent_back` round.
- `plan_check` and `quality_gate` are the latest `check.finished` of that check: `{outcome, head_sha, findings}` when it ran, `{outcome, head_sha, reason}` when skipped, null when absent.
- `merge_verdict` is the latest `merge_verdict` that ran, `{decision, head_sha}`, null when none ran, so a missing verdict reads apart from a NO or a YES on an older head.
- `verdict_on_head` is true when, for every merged PR, the latest `merge_verdict` that ran on its merged head (the gate's rule: the shorter sha, at least 7 hex, is a prefix of the longer) said yes; null until every PR the lane held has merged (a stack lane with a layer still open is null, not true).
- The review numbers read `check.finished` `local_review` and `pr_review` that ran (R11's `review.finished` and `finding.recorded`, events.md "Replaced names"). `head_reviewed`: every merged head has a local review on it (null until every PR has merged, as `verdict_on_head`). `flat_rounds`: adjacent local scores, recorded after the lane's first PR and ordered by daisy's job id, where the later is not higher. `reraised_findings`: verified findings grouped by trimmed lowercased title, the distinct jobs in each group minus one, summed. `verified_findings`: findings (by `finding_key`, once each) whose latest record in job order is verified. `verified_findings_after_handoff`: those whose latest record is on a review recorded after the first real handoff (one whose `next_action` does not start with `reviewing`, else the earliest; all of them when there is no handoff). The time is when Chaperone recorded the review, since daisy's finish time is not stored, so a review recorded late counts as after.
- `commits_after_handoff` is always null: it is a git count (events.md, PR), not a ledger read.

`cohort` has `lanes`, `with_pr`, `merged`, `too_few_lanes` (under 25: flagged, not scored), `claim_to_merge_h_median`, `tokens` (summed per source; a message recorded on two lanes of the cohort, which usage's worktree match allows, counts on each), `attention` (summed per type), R11's first five (`lanes_with_usage` (lanes with a parent `input_total`), `peak_context_median`, `context_tokens_per_merged_pr_median` (parent `input_total` over the PR count, merged lanes with usage), `lanes_peak_over_500k`; `lanes_reviewed` (lanes with a recorded review: the coverage of row 2's sums), `flat_rounds`, `reraised_findings`; `lanes_head_reviewed`; `lanes_with_commits_after_handoff`, `verified_findings`, `verified_findings_after_handoff`; `lanes_plan_checked`, `plan_check_skipped` and `quality_gate_skipped` (counts by reason), `lanes_quality_gated`, `lanes_verdict_on_head`, the last two over lanes with a PR as R11 defines), and `missing`. A median is over the non-null lane values, rounded to two decimals, and null when there are none. `missing` maps each cohort number printed as null because nothing records its input (by its cohort name; the lane fields of the same rows are null for the same reason) to what it needs: `lanes_with_commits_after_handoff` always, the three token numbers of row 1 when no lane in the cohort has a parent `input_total` (`lanes_peak_over_500k` is then null, not 0), and every review number when no lane in the cohort has a recorded review (with one, a lane without a review counts as unreviewed, not unknown).

`impact` (#43) lists the files that depend on the given files, nearest first, so an agent or a reviewer sees what a change might reach beyond its diff. It never opens the ledger. It runs in the current directory's git worktree: one `git rev-parse`, one `git config --get remote.origin.url`, and two `git ls-files` (the tracked files with their blob ids; the changed, deleted and untracked ones, which stats every tracked file), all four at once, then `git hash-object` (per 1,000 paths) for clean files the cache lacks, all under the same git rules as `overlap` and one 5 s deadline; output past 64 MiB from any of them fails `internal` rather than answer from a cut list. Targets are paths from the repo root, or from the current directory, or absolute. It reads Rust files and `Cargo.toml` manifests: a clean tracked file by its blob id (when its bytes still hash to it; else by their sha256), a changed or untracked one from the worktree, so the answer is for the worktree as it is now. Facts per file (its `mod` declarations, paths, `use` names, `impl` self types) are parsed with tree-sitter and cached by content in one SQLite file per origin, shared by every worktree and clone ([ADR 0043](decisions/0043-code-graph-cache.md)); `--cache` names another file. Module nodes and import edges are rebuilt in memory on each call ([R43](research/r43-change-graph.md)). `data` is `{bound, cache, depths, files_omitted, stale, targets, unsure, unsure_omitted}`. `targets` is `{path, known, lang, module}` per target: `known` false for a path that is not a Rust file or `Cargo.toml` in the tree, `lang` `rust` or null (no edges are read for other files yet). `depths` is `{depth, bound, files: [{path, module}], files_omitted}`: depth 1 names a target directly, depth 2 names a depth 1 file, to the full closure; at most 500 files are listed over all depths, the rest counted per depth and in `files_omitted`. `bound` is `exact`, or `lower_bound` when some Rust file's references are not all known, so any depth, and an empty answer, may miss files: `unsure` lists those files with `why` (`unparsed`, `parse_error`, `path_attr`, `include`, `super_past_root`, `too_deep` for nesting past 256 levels, `orphan` for a file no crate root reaches), the first 20, the rest in `unsure_omitted`. `stale` is true when some Rust file of the tree could not be read (over 256 KiB, or unreadable). `cache` is `{parsed, reused, skipped?}`: `skipped` says why the cache was not used (the answer is then parsed in full); a SQLite file SQLite calls corrupt is renamed to `.bad`, never deleted; any other file is left alone. Not in a git worktree: `invalid_input` with git's line.

Lease: `--lease-secs` defaults to 900, minimum 30, maximum 86400. Claiming a `done` or
`cancelled` item is `invalid_input`.

`check record` is new (#16, next to `reviews record`). The recorder passes its own
`--session`. The write is refused when that session is any session that has held the
lane (events.md, producer). `--head` is 7 to
40 lowercase hex digits. `--reason` is required with `skipped` and must be one the check allows
(events.md). `--decision` is required for `merge_verdict` and refused for every other
check. `--findings <n>` is required for a `plan_check` or `quality_gate` that ran and
refused elsewhere. It prints `{event_id, work_id, kind, replayed, at, payload}`.

`reviews record` reads `daisy-cli reviews get <job>`. That is Chaperone's only call into
daisy. A job that is not done (`data.done` false, status `queued` or `running`) appends
`check.requested`. A done job with status `reviewed` or `posted` appends `check.finished`
`ran` with `producer {kind: daisy_worker, job}`. A done job with status `failed` or
`cancelled` appends `check.finished` `skipped` with `reason` that status. It projects
`daisy_review.state` as `failed`, which `daisy_review_settled` rejects (a review that
never ran is a blocker, not a skip, R10), and adds no local round. M1's `handoff` does
not read `daisy_review_settled` (only the three stamps below), so this fact matters from
the first pipeline that requires it. `reviews get --wait` does not
block on a job that is only requested, so lanes keep `daisy-cli reviews get --wait` for
waiting. `reviews get` and `jobs get`
answer from what was recorded, in daisy's shape (the job's `check.finished`, else its
`check.requested`). Their keys are daisy's. Daisy's free text (`summary`, `impact`,
`intent_note`, `verdict_reason`, `error`, `report_path`, `worktree_path`) is not stored and
reads as null, and so does what only daisy knows in `jobs get` (cost, tokens, `job_dir`,
`round`). In `jobs get`, `work_id` is the lane the job is recorded on, `started_at` is when
Chaperone first recorded the job, and `finished_at` is when it recorded the finish (null
before), not daisy's times.
Findings come from the stored payload, and each one's `outcome` is its row's `fixed` or
`answered`, else null. `reviews record` prints the `reviews get` answer.

`reviews record` refuses (`invalid_input`, nothing written): a view whose `job_id` is not
`--job`, a view with no `done` or `status`, a done job with a status other than
`reviewed`, `posted`, `failed` or `cancelled`, a job recorded on another lane, a job whose repo, branch or PR is not the lane's (below), a finding with
no id, severity or title, and findings whose ids repeat.
A job's repo, branch or PR is not the lane's when its `repo` is not the lane's `repo_slug`, a local job's
`branch` is not the lane's `branch`, or a PR job's `pr_ref` is not the lane's `pr_ref`. Each is
checked only where the lane has it; `repo` and `pr_ref` ignore case. Daisy
is found at `/Applications/daisy.app/Contents/MacOS/daisy-cli`
([R15](research/r15-migration.md)), or at `CHAPERONE_DAISY_CLI`, and given 30 s. Its exit
5 (`runtime_unavailable`) and its `not_found` pass through. Any other failure, a timeout or output that is not daisy's envelope
is `internal`, with what daisy said in `details`, so daisy's exit codes never take
Chaperone's meanings.
`CHAPERONE_DAISY_CLI` is trusted like `--session` (an honor system until adapters): whoever
runs `reviews record` can point it at any program.

## Commands and transitions

Each command is one transaction that appends one event (events.md, write rules).

| Command | Transition | Event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `work handoff` with `ready: true`, or with status `done` | `handoff` (gated) | `phase.entered`, or `gate.denied` |
| `work update --status done` | `handoff` (gated) | `phase.entered`, or `gate.denied` |
| `work handoff`, any other (a `needs you` or progress handoff) | ungated | `lane.handed_off` |
| `work update --status queued` from `done` or `cancelled` | ungated | `lane.reopened` |
| `work update --status cancelled`, `work cancel` | ungated | `lane.cancelled` |
| `work update`, any other change | ungated | `lane.updated`, or `pr.opened` when the PR goes from null to set |
| `work claim`, `release`, `ready` | ungated | the matching `lane.*` kind |
| `work heartbeat` | none | none |
| `migrate` | none | none (schema only) |

A gated command on a lane with no stamp (never claimed) is denied with gate `stamp_ok` and fact path `lane.pipeline_hash`. It is never ungated and never falls back to the latest pipeline. A gated command whose route has no matching transition is denied the same way, never passed.

`handoff` is the M1 gated transition. Its requires list is per route in
`pipelines/v17.1.toml` (#34; lanes stamped `v17` keep `pipelines/v17.toml`, #12). A
handoff with `ready: true` on `code_pr` or `direct` needs a `plan_check`, a
`quality_gate`, and a `merge_verdict` with decision `yes` on the handed-off sha
(`handoff.commit`, or for `update --status done` the commit of the lane's latest
handoff). The two shas match when the shorter, at least 7 hex characters, is a prefix of
the longer, whichever side it is on (v17: the verdict's sha must be the prefix). A
handoff to `done` or `update --status done`, on every route, needs the plan check and
quality gate (a lane that changes no code may skip them with an allowed reason), and on
a `code` lane the same YES verdict on the handed-off sha; a `docs`, `measure` or
`investigation` lane needs no verdict and no `commit`. A `code` lane without that verdict
is denied as `done_verdict`. A handoff with `ready: true` on `investigation` or `no_pr` is always
denied: an investigation hands off `needs you`, never ready (R7). `phase.entered.to` is `done` for a handoff to `done`
or `update --status done`, else `ready`, and `phase.entered.status` is the status the
command asked for, not R7's mapping from `to`. Ready comes from a
handoff's `ready` (or the owner's `work ready` override), so a handoff cannot mark a lane
ready without passing this gate. There is no `next_action` fallback for ready (events.md,
folded rows). A `needs you` handoff is not gated, so it always reaches the owner. A
missing fact fails closed. The route comes from `work create`'s `--kind` and `--pr-flow`
(events.md, lane facts). The
denial exits 1 with `gate_denied`, names the failing gate id on stderr, and leaves the
lane where it was.

`usage report` is new (#59). It reads the transcripts that started in the lane's
`worktree_path` and appends one `usage.reported` per provider message the lane does not
have (events.md, Usage). `/ship` is to run it after each handoff once lanes run on Chaperone, and anyone may run it on demand.
It skips the holder rule, as `check record` does. `--claude-dir` defaults to
`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, else `~/.claude` when it exists. `--codex-dir` defaults to `$CODEX_HOME`,
else `~/.codex` when it exists. A folder from a flag or a variable is used as given. It
refuses (`invalid_input`, nothing written) a lane with no `worktree_path` or one that is not an
absolute folder below `/` (which would match every transcript or none), a folder that does
not exist, and a run with no folder at all. Entries in `projects` that are not folders are
skipped. A file or folder it cannot read is `internal`, naming the path, and the report
writes nothing. It prints `{work_id, written, existing, pending, sessions}`.
`sessions` lists each matched transcript as `{cli, session_id, agent_id, messages, pending,
unknown}`, with ids and counts only.

`usage get` prints `{work_id, known, totals, sources}`. `totals` is keyed by `source`
(`parent`, `subagent`), and `sources` has one row per transcript (`source`, `cli`, `session_id`,
`agent_id`, `agent_type`, `description`, `models`). Both carry `messages`, `peak_input_total`
and the sums of `cache_read`, `cache_write`, `output`, `reasoning`, `input_total` and
`output_total`. Only the transcript rows carry `uncached_input`, since its meaning differs
by CLI (Codex's includes the cache). A sum skips the messages where that field is null, and is
null when every message has it null. `known` is false when the lane has no usage event.

Where these numbers differ from `lane-stats`:

- `lane-stats`' `context_tokens` is the sum of `input_total`, but it counts a missing key as 0.
  Here a message with a missing key has a null `input_total`, which the sum skips.
- A message still streaming at the end of a transcript is counted by `lane-stats` and is
  pending here until it stops or the transcript has been idle for 10 minutes.
- `lane-stats` counts a message id once per transcript. Here it counts once per lane, so a
  resumed or forked session that copies earlier messages adds them once, and a lane total
  can be lower than `lane-stats`. Which transcript row a copied message lands on follows
  the scan order.
- `lane-stats` splits a session evenly between stack lanes that share a worktree. Here each
  lane that matches a session records its messages.
- `lane-stats` also matches old daisy items by branch name when they have no worktree path.
  Here a lane without `worktree_path` is refused.
- `lane-stats` reads Claude only. Codex rollouts are counted here, with Codex subagents
  under `subagent`.

## What lane-stats reads

These fields keep their daisy names and meaning:

- `work events`: `action` and `at` per item. `action` is daisy's word (`create`, `claim`,
  `renew`, `takeover`, `update`, `reopen`, `cancel`, `release`, `handoff`,
  `ready_override`), mapped from the event kind (`pr.opened` is `update`, `phase.entered`
  is the command's). `gate.denied`, `check.*`, `finding.updated`, `usage.reported`, `pr.merged` and `attention.recorded` are not lane actions
  and do not appear in `work events`.
- `work handoffs`: `created_at` and `handoff.next_action`.

## Not in M1

- `reviews stats`: deferred to a follow-up before the skill switch.
- `reviews local`, `reviews pr`, `reviews run`, `reviews wait`: lanes keep calling
  `daisy-cli` for these. The worker stays in daisy.
- `jobs list`, `jobs events`, `capabilities`, `doctor`, `schema`.
- Daisy's personal hub (`issues`, `notes`, `inbox`, `settings`, `chat`, the mirrors,
  `memory`, `context`, `search`): never.
- No id floor, no router, no `linear_outbox`. Ids are plain integers. `source` and
  `--repo` are stored as given, and `linear_state` is always `null`.
