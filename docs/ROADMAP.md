# Chaperone roadmap

Status: **locked**, 2026-11-03. This is the single source for product decisions, architecture,
phases, and success bars. Research evidence lives in [research/](research/) (R1–R15).
[VISION.md](VISION.md) is the north star; this doc is what we build and in what order.

## Locked decisions (2026-11-03)

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Product name | **Chaperone** ([ADR 0005](decisions/0005-chaperone-name.md)): packages `chaperone-cli`, `chaperone-ui`, repo `chaperone` |
| License | **MIT OR Apache-2.0** |
| Open source | **Public from first code commit**; `0.x` until contract/schema settle; **1.0** = milestone 8 quality bar |
| Language | **Rust**, reuse **daisy-core** where it fits |
| Ledger | **SQLite WAL**, `synchronous=FULL`, event + state fold in **one transaction** |
| Agent integration | **MCP server + headless lifecycle** (v0 contract in R4); adapters **Claude Code, Codex, Cursor** first |
| Process engine | **Versioned TOML** pipeline + **host predicates**; v17 expressible; engine **refuses** transitions |
| Verification | Checks as **ledger events**; **daisy reviewer stays in the daisy app** for now |
| Security baseline | **Redact at write**; review/PR/tool text **cannot satisfy gates**; unattended lanes require CLI sandbox |
| Engineering bar | [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) + [r14](research/r14-engineering-standards.md) (nextest, property/crash/concurrency/fake-agent, perf budgets) |
| Milestone order | Default sequence below (no reorder requested) |

Prior name research: [r3](research/r3-name-and-license.md), [ADR 0001](decisions/0001-name-license-oss-posture.md).

## Herdr vs Chaperone (how you work)

**herdr** stays where you **start and talk to agents**: panes, keyboard, splits, `spawn`, daily
typing. That does not change through milestone 1 and remains the preferred viewer after the
runtime milestone.

**Chaperone** is the **background control plane**:

- Ledger (work, spec, gates, findings, messages)
- Process engine (pipeline version per lane, refused transitions)
- Lane-to-lane coordination (reservations, seams, typed inbox)
- Metrics and attention (`chaperone attention`, notifications from ledger rules)
- Agent adapters (MCP, lifecycle events) so lanes record facts without you babysitting

```text
You ──► herdr pane ──► agent CLI (Claude / Codex / Cursor)
              │
              └── attach / spawn unchanged in early phases

Chaperone ◄── chaperone CLI (daisy-cli argv), ledger, gates, MCP ◄── agents (events, checks)
              │
              └── later: optional `chaperone attach` if you want; herdr still fine
```

Rules:

- **Do not** replace herdr with a Chaperone chat UI ([VISION](VISION.md) non-goal).
- **Do not** use herdr pane ids as lane identity in the ledger ([R8](research/r8-process-terminal-runtime.md)).
- **Milestone 6** may add `chaperone supervise` as process parent; **default UX** remains
  **command in herdr pane = `chaperone attach <lane>`** (or today’s spawn path until attach exists).
- Chaperone does **not** ship a tmux/zellij replacement; it may integrate as viewer client only.

## What we are not building

Own LLM loop, hosted multi-tenant SaaS, primary chat UI, GitHub/Linear replacement, or
reimplementing daisy’s full personal hub ([VISION](VISION.md)).

## Architecture (accepted stack)

One paragraph per layer; detail in linked research.

1. **CLI surface**: `chaperone` keeps `daisy-cli`'s argv, envelope and exit codes, so skills
   switch by binary path after the demo; no router ([cli-contract.md](cli-contract.md), [ADR 0003](decisions/0003-chaperone-replaces-daisy.md)).
2. **Ledger**: Append-only events + projected rows, standalone; daisy does not read it ([R5](research/r5-state-and-storage.md), [events.md](events.md)).
3. **Engine** — Load pinned TOML pipeline; deny transitions; stamp process version on claim ([R7](research/r7-process-engine.md)).
4. **Verification**: Plan check, quality gate, reviews, verdict, smoke → `check.finished`,
   folded into `gate_results`; reviewer worker in daisy app ([R10](research/r10-verification-review-layer.md)).
5. **Adapters** — Per CLI: brief file, harness MCP, stream-json lifecycle ([R4](research/r4-agent-cli-integration.md)).
6. **Coordination** — Spec reservations, seam revisions, `seam.ack` / `seam.reject` only ([R9](research/r9-coordination-between-lanes.md)).
7. **Observability** — All `lane-stats` numbers become ledger queries; five metrics first ([R11](research/r11-observability-cost-metrics.md)).
8. **Attention** — `chaperone attention` JSON queues; interrupt rules in [R12](research/r12-interfaces-and-attention.md).

## Success bar (milestone 1)

Measured against **v16** baseline ([R2](research/r2-own-evidence.md)); cohorts under 25 lanes
are flagged, not scored ([R11](research/r11-observability-cost-metrics.md)).

| Metric | v16 baseline (indicative) | M1 target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Head reviewed (PR lanes) | 15 / 28 | **100%** |
| Plan check / quality gate / verdict on handed-off sha | 6 / 0 / 0 of 28 | **100%** (or explicit skip reason) |
| Context per merged PR (median) | 19.1M | **≤ 23M** |
| Peak context (median) | 240k | **≤ 300k**; no lane **> 500k** |
| Flat rounds (cohort ~39 lanes) | 25 | **≤ 12** |
| Re-raised findings | 37 | **≤ 18** |
| Lanes with commits after handoff | 10 / 39 (~26%) | **≤ 10%** |
| Verified findings after handoff | ~40% | **≤ 20%** |

Gate stamps without context improvement is a failed experiment; both matter.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Docs and contract freeze (now → first code)

- [x] Research R1–R15
- [x] Lock roadmap (this file)
- [ ] ADRs 0002+ or treat this roadmap as architecture record
- [x] Publish integration contract + event schema drafts (versioned) before implementation: [events.md](events.md), [cli-contract.md](cli-contract.md)
- [ ] GitHub org or repo `chaperone` when ready ([ADR 0005](decisions/0005-chaperone-name.md) open items); no empty crate/npm squat

**Exit:** First Rust PR has a bar ([R14](research/r14-engineering-standards.md)).

---

### Phase 1 — Milestone 1: Ledger + gates (lanes never stop)

Goal: **enforced v17 gates on new ledger lanes** while **herdr + spawn + skills** stay how you work.

Slices of #1 (one issue each). Chaperone replaces daisy's ledger; no router, no dual store
([ADR 0003](decisions/0003-chaperone-replaces-daisy.md)).

| Step | Issue | Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 | #2 | Event schema, CLI contract, ADR 0003 (docs) |
| 1.2 | #3 | Rust workspace scaffold with CI |
| 1.3 | #4 | Ledger file with migrations (R5 schema, runtime columns nullable) |
| 1.4 | #5, #6 | The one write function; crash and concurrency tests |
| 1.5 | #7, #8, #9 | `chaperone work` in daisy's shape: create/get/list, claim/update/heartbeat/release/cancel, handoff/handoffs/events/ready |
| 1.6 | #10, #11 | `chaperone spec`: create/get/list/update/approve, decide and `get --key` |
| 1.7 | #12, #13, #14 | Pipeline loader, hash and `v17.toml`; predicate evaluator; fact projection and stamp at claim |
| 1.8 | #15 | Engine refuses handoff and done without plan check, QG and a YES verdict on the sha |
| 1.9 | #16 | `check record` and `reviews record` write check events; worker still in daisy app |

**Still in dotfiles for M1:** all pipeline skills, `ship-handoff`, `spawn`, herdr parent,
`lane-stats` transcript scan, `pipeline-profile`, changelog.

**Not in M1:** MCP adapters on the hot path, `chaperone supervise`, coordination (R9), adapter-written usage events (M1's `usage.reported` comes from transcripts), switching the skills to `chaperone` (after the demo).

**Exit:** M1 success bar table above on ledger-lane cohorts; zero stopped in-flight lanes.

---

### Phase 2 — Event-driven waiting

- Subscriptions: review done, CI green, sibling merged, dependency cleared ([R4](research/r4-agent-cli-integration.md), [R8](research/r8-process-terminal-runtime.md))
- Replace `/orchestrate` **300s poll** and ad hoc `gh`/`daisy` poll loops where events suffice
- Agents and orchestrator wake on ledger notifications

**Exit:** Poll turns down materially on orchestrated runs ([R2](research/r2-own-evidence.md) baseline ~263/lane v16).

---

### Phase 3 — Lane coordination

- Spec reservations before code; seam publish/revise; typed inbox ([R9](research/r9-coordination-between-lanes.md))
- Overlap and stack rules enforced at grant and at ready
- Still no free-text agent chat between lanes

**Exit:** Design cases in R9 covered in tests; fewer “helper reimplemented” / overlap findings.

---

### Phase 4 — Process versions as experiments

- Two pipeline TOML versions on comparable slices ([R7](research/r7-process-engine.md))
- Cohort metrics from R11 compared fairly (pipeline hash on `lane.claimed`)
- Roll forward/back via pinned hash, not prose changelog edits alone

**Exit:** A process change is a number (rounds, escapes, tokens, attention), not a feeling.

---

### Phase 5 — Verification evidence store

- Screenshots, logs, command output → content-addressed evidence ([R10](research/r10-verification-review-layer.md))
- Smoke and kept-test proof linked from gate rows
- Optional: move more review orchestration into harness while worker stays in daisy

**Exit:** Every v17 gate has stored evidence ref where the pipeline requires it.

---

### Phase 6 — Runtime (optional parent swap)

- `chaperone supervise`: worktree, port block, PTY, wait, `lane resume` ([R8](research/r8-process-terminal-runtime.md))
- **herdr pane runs `chaperone attach <lane>`** (or spawn updated to invoke attach); you still **start from herdr**
- Retire `spawn` as parent when supervise is stable; ledger identity unchanged

**Exit:** Agent survives viewer detach; stall/death is ledger events, not screen scrape.

---

### Phase 7 — Interfaces

- **`chaperone attention`** shipped in M1 or early Phase 2; this phase adds **TUI** and/or **local web**
- Notification subscriber replaces agents calling `herdr notification show` ([R12](research/r12-interfaces-and-attention.md))

**Exit:** One glance answers needs-you / ready / stuck / expensive without opening every pane.

---

### Phase 8 — Open source 1.0

Quality bar from [VISION](VISION.md): ADRs for major choices, property/crash/concurrency tests,
fake-agent whole-lane tests, perf budgets in CI, versioned public contract, security rules ([R13](research/r13-security-and-trust.md)), dogfood own development in Chaperone lanes.

**Exit:** Tag `1.0.0`; stable integration contract and event schema.

---

## Migration

No router and no dual store: see [ADR 0003](decisions/0003-chaperone-replaces-daisy.md).
Lanes in flight finish in daisy; new lanes move when the skills switch to `chaperone`.

## Next actions (implementation)

1. Scaffold **Rust workspace** per R14 (`chaperone-cli`, `chaperone-core`, …) (#3).
2. Ledger file, write function and its tests (#4 to #6).
3. `chaperone work` and `spec` in daisy's shape (#7 to #11).
4. Pipeline, evaluator, projection, engine refusals and check events through M1 exit criteria (#12 to #16).
5. After the demo: switch the skills to `chaperone`.
6. After #53: the agent dossier per issue key ([ADR 0007](decisions/0007-issue-dossier.md)); `/issue` reads it from the skill switch.

[PLAN.md](PLAN.md) is superseded by this file.
